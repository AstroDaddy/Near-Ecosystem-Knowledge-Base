# ðŸ—ƒ Got Docs?

### What

This repository contains Markdown documenting as many NEAR projects as possible. Public developer docs, end user docs, blog posts, etc are the sort of documentation we're talking about.

### Why

Gitbook has AI enabled, let's pile all of the Near documentation we can find into this repository to see how it does.&#x20;

The repository will also serve as an open source (CC0) data set that can be used to train and benchmark other AI systems.&#x20;

## How

1. Find some docs you want to import.
2. Claim Heroes Bounty
3. Make a branch.
4. Add the content.
5. Submit a PR.
6. Submit Heroes Bounty.&#x20;

### Hack

Long term/big vision would be to enable this repository as a super scraper which collections URLs for content & updates itself when there are changes to that content. Contact us if you have an implementation proposal.&#x20;
